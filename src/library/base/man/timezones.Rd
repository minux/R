\title{Time Zones}
\description{
  Information about time zones in \R.  \code{Sys.timezone} returns
  the current time zone.
}

\usage{
Sys.timezone(location = TRUE)

OlsonNames()
}

\arguments{
  \item{location}{logical: should an attempt be made to find the
    location name as used in the Olson database?  (See \sQuote{Time zone
      names} below.)}
}

\details{
  Time zones are a system-specific topic, but these days almost all \R
  platforms use similar underlying code, used by Linux, OS X,
  Solaris, AIX, FreeBSD, Sun Java >= 1.4 and Tcl >= 8.5, and installed
  with \R on Windows.  Unfortunately there are many system-specific
  errors in the implementations.

  It should be possible to set the time zone via the environment
  variable \env{TZ}: see the section on \sQuote{Time zone names} for
  suitable values.  \code{Sys.timezone()} will return the value of
  \env{TZ} if set (and on some OSes it is always set), otherwise it will
  try to retrieve a value which if set for \env{TZ} would give the
  current time zone.  This is not in general possible, and
  \code{Sys.timezone(FALSE)} on Windows will retrieve the abbreviation
  used for the current time.

  If \env{TZ} is set but empty or invalid, most platforms default to
  \samp{UTC}, the time zone colloquially known as \samp{GMT} (see
  \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time}).

  Time zones did not come into use until the second half of the
  nineteenth century and were not widely adopted until the twentieth,
  and \emph{daylight saving time} (DST, also known as \emph{summer
  time}) was first introduced in the early twentieth century, most
  widely in 1916. Over the last 100 years places have changed their
  affiliation between major time zones, have opted out of (or in to) DST
  in various years or adopted rule changes late or not at all.
  
  The most common system implementation of \code{POSIXct} is as signed
  32-bit integers and so only goes back to the end of 1901: on such
  systems \R assumes that dates prior to that are in the same time zone
  as they were in 1902.  Most of the world had not adopted time zones by
  1902 but for some places there had been time-zone changes before then.
  64-bit representations are becoming common (and \R can be configured
  to use one on a Unix-alike and does on Windows); unfortunately on some
  OSes the database information is only available for the range
  1901--2038.
}

\value{
  \code{Sys.timezone} returns an OS-specific character string, possibly
  \code{NA} or an empty string (which on some OSes means \samp{UTC})..
  For the default \code{location = TRUE} this will be a location such as
  \code{"Europe/London"} if one can be ascertained.  For \code{location
  = FALSE} this may be an abbreviation such as \code{"EST"} or
  \code{"CEST"} on Windows.

  \code{OlsonNames} returns a character vector.
}

\section{Time zone names}{
  Where OSes describe their valid time zones can be obscure.  The help
  for the C function \code{tzset} can be helpful, but it can also be
  inaccurate.  There is a cumbersome POSIX specification (listed under
  environment variable \env{TZ} at
  \url{http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08}),
  which is often at least partially supported, but there are other more
  user-friendly ways to specify time zones.

  Many systems make use of a time-zone database originally compiled by
  Arthur David Olson (and now managed by IANA),
  in which the preferred way to refer to a time zone is by a location
  (typically of a city) e.g. \code{Europe/London},
  \code{America/Los_Angeles}, \code{Pacific/Easter}.  Some traditional
  designations are also allowed such as \code{EST5EDT} or
  \code{GB}.  (Beware that some of these designations may not be what you
  think: in particular \code{EST} is a time zone used in Canada
  \emph{without} daylight saving time, and not \code{EST5EDT} nor
  (Australian) Eastern Standard Time.)  The designation can also be an
  optional colon prepended to the path to a file giving complied zone
  information (and the examples above are all files in a system-specific
  location).  See \url{http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm} for more
  details and references.  By convention, regions with a unique time-zone
  history since 1970 have specific names, but those with different
  earlier histories may not.  Each time zone has one or two (the second
  for DST) abbreviations used when formatting times.

  Note that that the abbreviations have changed over the years: for
  example France used \samp{PMT} (\sQuote{Paris Mean Time}) from 1891 to
  1911 then \samp{WET/WEST} up to 1940 and \samp{CET/CEST} from 1946.
  Software will generally use the current abbreviation(s), and the POSIX
  standard allows only one or two abbreviations per time zone.
  
  The function \code{OlsonNames} returns the names known to the Olson
  database on the current system.
#ifdef unix

  Most Unix-alikes use the Olson database.  The system-specific
  location in the file system varies, e.g.  \file{/usr/share/zoneinfo}
  (Linux, OS X, FreeBSD), \file{/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo} (Solaris, AIX),
  \ldots.  It is likely that there is a file named something like
  \file{zone.tab} under that directory listing the locations known as
  time-zone names (but not for example \code{EST5EDT}): this is read by
  \code{OlsonNames}.  See also
  \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone.tab}.

  Where \R was configured with option \option{--with-internal-tzcode},
  the database at \code{file.path(R.home("share"), "zoneinfo")} is used
  by default: file \file{VERSION} in that directory gives the version.
  An alternative directory can be specified \emph{via} environment
  variable \env{TZDIR}.
#endif
#ifdef windows

  \R under Windows uses the Olson database.  The current version of the
  database will be given in file
  \file{\var{\link{R_HOME}}\\share\\zoneinfo\\VERSION}.
  Environment variable \env{TZDIR} can be used to point to a later
  \file{zoneinfo} directory.  A file listing most known time zones can be
  found at \file{\var{\link{R_HOME}}\\share\\zoneinfo\\zone.tab} (see
  \sQuote{Examples}).   By convention, regions with a unique time-zone
  history since 1970 have specific names, but those with different
  earlier histories may not.

  An attempt is made (once only per session) to map Windows' idea of the
  current time zone to a location, following an earlier version of
  \url{http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/trunk/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml}
  It can be overridden by setting the \env{TZ} environment variable.

  Windows documents a specification of the form \code{GST-1GDT}: this is
  interpreted as POSIX-like and hence the \sQuote{US rules} for changing
  to/from DST are applied (and are incorrect for Germany).  Versions of
  \R prior to 2.7.0 used Windows' system functions and hence this form:
  it is still accepted for backwards compatibility but was (and remains)
  unreliable and gives a warning.
#endif

  Most platforms support time zones of the form \samp{GMT+n} and
  \samp{GMT-n}, which are at a fixed offset from UTC (hence no DST).
  Contrary to some usage (but consistent with names such as
  \samp{PST8PDT}), negative offsets are times ahead of (east of) UTC,
  positive offsets are times behind (west of) UTC.
}

\note{
  Since 2007 there has been considerable disruption over changes to the
  timings of the DST transitions, aimed at energy conservation.  These
  often have short notice and time-zone databases may not be up to date.

  Note that except on Windows, the operation of time zones is an OS
  service, and even on Windows a third-party database is used and can be
  updated (see the section on \sQuote{Time zone names}).  Incorrect
  results will never be an \R issue, so please ensure that you have the
  courtesy not to blame \R for them.
