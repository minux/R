localtime.c is a stripped-down version of that from tzcode, from
http://www.iana.org/time-zones .  Apart from removing unused code and
merging in the parts of private.h which are needed, the main changes
are

- to use environment variable TZDIR to point to the zoneinfo files, and
  failing that, R_HOME/share/zoneinfo.

- to call getTZinfo() to get the default timezone if TZ is unset.


zoneinfo.zip is formed by installing tzcode/tzdata on Linux, and
zipping up the results, after adding a file VERSION giving the
version.  It should be possible to build the compiled databases on
Windows, but zic.c assumes links and so would need a lot of work.  (It
look like the binary databases are byte streams, and so do not depend
on the architecture.  There are some comments about whether time_t is
signed, which it is on all sensible platforms.)

To remake it, use a machine with zic in the path (it may be /usr/sbin/zic).
Copy the current version of tzdataXXXXx.tar.gz to this directory and run

make -f Make.zi VERSION=2013h

for the appropriate version.
